Backward and forward
====================

The sign outside reads: Name no one man.

"Escape. We must escape." Staring at the locked door of his cage, Beta Rabbit, spy and brilliant mathematician, has a revelation. "Of course! Name no one man - it's a palindrome! Palindromes are the key to opening this lock!"

To help Beta Rabbit crack the lock, write a function answer(n) which returns the smallest positive integer base b, at least 2, in which the integer n is a palindrome. The input n will satisfy "0 <= n <= 1000."
